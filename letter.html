    Dear Eileen,<br>
    <section>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
        Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your
        <div class="tooltiptext">PhD
            <span class=tooltiptext>"Doctor of Philosophy"</span>
        </div>
        (Doctor of Philosophy) next year. I will answer your
        questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </section><br>
    Starting dates<br>

    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
    however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
    semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:

    First semester: 9 September 2016
    Second semester: 15 January 2017
    Third semester: 2 May 2017

    Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would
    prefer.

    Subjects of study

    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research
    facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science
    and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
    just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the
    ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of
    priority:

    Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
    (C14H12O3).
    Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures
    exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
    (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104).
    HTML, Hypertext Markup Language, and CSS,
    Cascading Style Sheets, constructs for representing musical scores.

    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
    including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and
    other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

    Exotic dance moves

    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I
    did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my
    favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:

    Polynesian chicken dance
    A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as
    300 BCE, a whole village would
    dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to
    be "fruitful".
    Icelandic brownian shuffle
    Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they
    used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a
    circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
    tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that
    he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
    Arctic robot dance
    An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in
    the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by
    "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern
    Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were
    just moving like this because they were really cold.
